# Summary

With the field of artificial intelligence and bioinformatics growing almost exponentially, programming languages have adapted to include more machine learning and deep learning libraries. Within Python, there are ``TensorFlow`` and ``SciKit-Learn``, modules that offer the ability for users to develop AI models with minimal keystrokes. The field of medical imaging, however, has not adapted with similar speed. Medical imaging tools used in medical offices across the world are rarely new and are not optimized for modern AI models. ``mednoise``, an open-source package designed entirely in Python, acts as a tool to process medical image metadata into usable formats for machine learning models. More specifically, mednoise removes unnecessary noise that has unremarkable clinical significance, yielding medical images that have the highest impact possible in bioinformatics research. It aims to create a future of medical imaging that is more utilizable in the constantly evolving field of bioinformatic research.
